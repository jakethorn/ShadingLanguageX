# WARNING
These examples were written while __ShadingLanguageX__ was being developed. It's possible that they will not compile as intended due to language features of __ShadingLanguageX__ being updated over time. I am keeping them here as a reference for developers as most of the code in them is still useful and valid, but they should not be copied verbatim.
