# WARNING
These examples were written while __ShadingLanguageX__ was being developed. It's highly likely that they will not compile or will not compile as intended due to language features of __ShadingLanguageX__ being updated over time. I am keeping them here as a reference for developers as most of the code in them is still useful and valid, but they should not be copied verbatim. I'll update them in the future to be of better use.
